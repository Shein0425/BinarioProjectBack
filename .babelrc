// This JSON configuration is used with Babel, a JavaScript compiler.
// It specifies the use of a single preset, `@babel/preset-env`.

// - "presets": This is an array that holds one or more Babel presets. In this case, there's only one preset listed.
// - "@babel/preset-env": This is the specific preset used. It tells Babel to apply transformations to the code to ensure it is compatible with the environments you intend to support.

// In short, this configuration is telling Babel to handle code transformations to ensure it works in different environments without specifying those environments explicitly in this configuration. It is a basic configuration to make your JavaScript code more compatible across various platforms and browsers.
